Hi, I'm the author of this blog. Thanks for visiting!

I started this site as a place to write about topics that interest me -- whether that's technology, projects I'm working on, or just things I find worth sharing.

## What you'll find here

- Thoughts on software and technology
- Notes on things I'm learning
- Occasional deep dives into topics I find interesting

## Get in touch
