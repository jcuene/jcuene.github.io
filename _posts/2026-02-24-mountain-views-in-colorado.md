This past weekend I headed out for a long-overdue day hike in the Colorado Rockies. The trail started just outside of town and wound its way up through a dense stand of aspen before opening onto a ridgeline with views in every direction.

## The Trail

The first few miles were a gradual climb through the trees, the kind of quiet that only comes when there's snow on the ground and no wind. By mile three the trail steepened, switchbacking up a rocky face until it crested the ridge.

## The Scenery

From the top, the peaks stretched out to the horizon — jagged and white against a deep blue sky. To the west, a long valley ran between two ridges, the frozen surface of a small lake catching the afternoon light. To the east, the plains spread out flat and brown and impossibly far.

It's the kind of view that makes the climb feel worth it every time.

## Getting Out There

If you're looking to do this trail, give yourself a full day and bring more water than you think you need. The elevation will remind you it's in charge.
