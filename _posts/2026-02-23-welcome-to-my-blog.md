Hello and welcome! This is my very first post.

I set up this blog using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). It's a simple, fast, and free way to publish a personal site -- no databases, no server management, just Markdown files and a git push.

## Why blog?

Writing helps me think more clearly. Putting ideas into words forces me to organize my thoughts and fill in the gaps in my understanding. If something I write ends up being useful to someone else, that's a bonus.

## What to expect

I plan to write about:

- Things I'm building or learning
- Interesting problems and how I approached them
- Tools and workflows that make my life easier

## How this site works

Every post is a Markdown file in the `_posts` directory. The filename follows the format `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`. Jekyll takes care of the rest -- converting Markdown to HTML, generating the RSS feed, and building the site.

To create a new post, I just add a file like this:

```
_posts/2026-02-23-my-new-post.md
```

With front matter at the top:

```yaml
---
layout: post
title: "My New Post"
date: 2026-02-23
---
```

Then write the content in Markdown below. Simple.

Thanks for reading. More to come soon!
